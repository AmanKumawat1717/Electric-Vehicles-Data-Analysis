# Electric-Vehicles-Data-Analysis

The supply of fossil fuels is constantly decreasing. The situation is very alarming. It is time for the world to slowly adapt to electric vehicles. A lot of change needs to happen. Major car makers like Tesla and Porsche manufacture many electric vehicles. The improvement of battery technology in recent years has led to the higher popularity of electric vehicles. Buying an electric vehicle can be a great choice for consumers. The drive quality, low noise levels, and convenience are really great. In the United States, one year of driving a petrol car can cost from 1500 USD to 2500 USD. On the other hand, the driving cost of Electric Vehicles is 500 USD. Electric cars are more preferable. The maintenance cost of electric vehicles is also very low. They are economical to maintain. The energy conversion efficiency of electric vehicles is also high. Electric vehicles use 60-70% of electrical energy. On the other hand, vehicles based on internal combustion engines have an efficiency of 18-22% only.

The lighter the colour, the more the correlation between the two data points. For example, we can see that price and top_speed have correlation of “0.83”, which is a good score. So, the correlation data has many real-life similarities.

Now, We plot some Acceleration related plot and check how acceleration is related with other factors.

So, from above figure. We can see the relation of acceleration with different parameters of Electric Vehicles.
Electric vehicles that having lower value of acceleartion or higher value of torque having higher Top_Speed, having highest range/km and also have high price.

So, from the both above analysis we can select those Models that having lower value of Acceleration/sec or highre value of torque and that having good range and fast charging feature.

<---------------------------------------------------------------STOCK DATA ANALYSIS------------------------------------------------------------->

Basically, Volume is nothing but the number of shares of a security traded during a given period of time.
Here, We can see their are spikes in the plot.
Like, In Tesla volume stock there is clear spike in starting of 2020. And there is a spike of green color which is of Nissan in late 2018.
When their is a sudden increase in Volume trade than there are more chances that the opening of stock will fall down.
Here, We consider the case of nissan Stock. On 2018-11-19 to 2018-11-20 there is maximum volume excahnge takes place as we see in the above plot.

In below figure,We can see the correlation between the opening stock price of these companies.

Let's Check the which stock is more volatile or we can say that which one is not good for long term investment.
In the below plot blue color looks more volatile over green and orange i.e., the stock of tesla having higher Standard Deviation as compare to Nissan and Volkswagen or we can say that Tesla Stocks are more volatile than other two.

For better Understanding just look at the below plot. Here, blue, green, orange represents Tesla , Nissan , Volkswagen Stocks. As we can see Tesla has more volatility and Nissan and Volkswagen are approx same. So, for long term investment Tesla stocks are not good bcoz they are more volatile.
