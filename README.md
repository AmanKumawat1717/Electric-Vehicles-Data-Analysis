# Electric-Vehicles-Data-Analysis

The supply of fossil fuels is constantly decreasing. The situation is very alarming. It is time for the world to slowly adapt to electric vehicles. A lot of change needs to happen. Major car makers like Tesla and Porsche manufacture many electric vehicles. The improvement of battery technology in recent years has led to the higher popularity of electric vehicles. Buying an electric vehicle can be a great choice for consumers. The drive quality, low noise levels, and convenience are really great. In the United States, one year of driving a petrol car can cost from 1500 USD to 2500 USD. On the other hand, the driving cost of Electric Vehicles is 500 USD. Electric cars are more preferable. The maintenance cost of electric vehicles is also very low. They are economical to maintain. The energy conversion efficiency of electric vehicles is also high. Electric vehicles use 60-70% of electrical energy. On the other hand, vehicles based on internal combustion engines have an efficiency of 18-22% only.

The lighter the colour, the more the correlation between the two data points. For example, we can see that price and top_speed have correlation of “0.83”, which is a good score. So, the correlation data has many real-life similarities.

Now, We plot some Acceleration related plot and check how acceleration is related with other factors.

So, from above figure. We can see the relation of acceleration with different parameters of Electric Vehicles.
Electric vehicles that having lower value of acceleartion or higher value of torque having higher Top_Speed, having highest range/km and also have high price.
